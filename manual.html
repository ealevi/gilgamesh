				<p>This manual refers to a project made in 2013 in order
				to help people and programmers which intend to use the artificial
				intelligence code called Gilgamesh. The Gilgamesh is an Artificial
				Intelligence library, using an alternative concept mixing some
				concepts between prolog and neural networks. Common users and
				programmers can use it in a large number of situations (which is
				attempted to show in this manual).</p>
				<p>The main purpose about all this
				work is to contribute with other as possible, helping people with
				their own objectives, using the knowledge described here to achieve
				that. Furthermore, it is expected for programmers use the code or
				ideas presented here to help other people, finding solutions to
				problems where computers are better than humans. Originally, the
				Gilgamesh code has been developed to help in stock market
				prediction, but it can be used in a wide range of areas. It is
				expected to receive some suggestions and ideas from you in order to
				improve it.</p>
				<p><b>History</b></p>
				<p>The Gilgamesh concept was created in the middle
				of 2013, but their concepts were thought for a long time so it was
				constructed based on them. All started around 2005, when a group of
				friends started an uncommitted AI project called Spirit Project. At
				that time, they made some meetings to learn and study some AI
				concepts, just for fun. They got good results, but around one year
				later the project ended up with more unsolved questions and
				disagreements than when it began. Since the end of Spirit project
				and during all those years, lots of possible solutions to the
				unsolved remaining problems came up. Actually, lot of solutions were
				created for some different concepts and implemented in Gilgamesh (it
				is up to you to decide if they will serve you or not). In 2013, an
				opportunity happens to put all the ideas together, releasing the
				Gilgamesh Artificial Intelligence Project (before it was called as
				Core Project) and since then, it is being used to predict stock
				market moves, with satisfactory results.</p>
				<p>After a while and being
				sure about its effectiveness, it was decided to share the code as
				open source and create this material to help people understand what
				the creator had in mind. It was created some small programs applied
				to various areas in order to give a start point for those who want
				to use them in a similar situation.</p>
				<p>All information and code
				available on this manual are not an academic study about AI or its
				math concepts. Its intent is to be a practical work for
				professionals or companies to get practical results using it. For
				that, it was attempted to provide all kind of help, about the
				concepts created and about the code developed, keeping everything as
				simple as possible, trying to achieve not only programmers, but
				enthusiasts and common public in general. Most concepts in this
				manual reflect the creator's opinions and his ideas about AI. It has
				no intention to argue about mathematical models or AI concepts.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="coreConceptsID" class="title3">Gilgamesh Core Concepts</div>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Almost all the concepts
				used into Gilgamesh were done thinking about blocks of information
				connected among them. It was like if we would have a bunch of
				neurons where each one could keep an entire block of information as
				we know. Besides that, it was attempted to use and adjust the code
				to be close enough about how some psychological concepts works in
				the brain.</p>
				<p>The Gilgamesh's block of information is called <b>atom</b> (like
				in some other AI programs). An atom can be a simple word, a number,
				a character or a group of all of them. A group of related atoms is
				called <b>fact</b>. Let's consider entering the information below in
				Gilgamesh's memory:</p>
				
				<table class="datatable">
					<thead> <tr> <td>Type<td> <td>Atom</td> <td>Atom</td> <td>Atom</td> </tr> </thead>
					<tbody> 
						<tr> <td style="background: lightgray;">Fact<td> <td>DOG</td> <td>EATS</td> <td>MEAT</td> </tr>
						<tr> <td style="background: lightgray;">Fact<td> <td>DOG</td> <td>EATS</td> <td>RATION</td> </tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
				
				<p>Gilgamesh connects atoms creating facts, indicating how many times
				each one occurred. For that, it uses a counter that works as memory
				prints called force in code for each fact:</p>
				
				<table class="datatable">
					<thead> <tr> <td>Type<td> <td>Atom</td> <td>Atom</td> <td>Atom</td> <td>Force</td> </tr> </thead>
					<tbody> 
						<tr> <td style="background: lightgray;">Fact<td> <td>DOG</td> <td>EATS</td> <td>MEAT</td> <td>1</td></tr>
						<tr> <td style="background: lightgray;">Fact<td> <td>DOG</td> <td>EATS</td> <td>RATION</td> <td>1</td></tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>

				<p>If we enter the information "DOG EATS MEAT" again, the state in Gilgamesh's memory will be:</p>
				
				<table class="datatable">
					<thead> <tr> <td>Type<td> <td>Atom</td> <td>Atom</td> <td>Atom</td> <td>Force</td> </tr> </thead>
					<tbody> 
						<tr> <td style="background: lightgray;">Fact<td> <td>DOG</td> <td>EATS</td> <td>MEAT</td> <td>2</td></tr>
						<tr> <td style="background: lightgray;">Fact<td> <td>DOG</td> <td>EATS</td> <td>RATION</td> <td>1</td></tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>

				<p>In this case, if the Gilgamesh is requested to answer some like
				"what does the dog eat?" providing the atoms "DOG" and "EATS" the
				answer will be "MEAT", since this atom is a member of a fact which
				occurs twice in memory.</p>

			<div class="content">
				<p>Gilgamesh has a command line interpreter, in order to
					simplify its general use (remember that you have to have Java 8 or
					later installed in your computer).</p>
				<p>To run Gilgamesh's Command Line in your local computer:
				<ol>
					<li>Download Gilgamesh latest version using this link: <a href="./files/gilgamesh-1.0.zip">Gilgamesh Zip File</a></li>
					<li>Copy it into a folder and unzip it</li>
					<li>Double click in "gilgamesh.bat" or execute "gilgamesh.sh" for Linux users.
					<li>The Command Shell screen will open:</li>

			<div id="commandShellID" class="title3">Command Shell</div>
			<div class="content">
				<p>The Gilgamesh starts with no memory so you have to teach it
					entering some facts. To teach it, you have to type your atoms
					(block of information) in a raw way.</p>
					<p>Gilgamesh is not programmed to
					understanding natural language what means if you want to enter the
					information like "My dog eats meat", you should enter only the essential
					information you need (dog eats meat).</p>
					<p>It can accept commands too if
					you put ; (semicolon) at the end or the middle of a typed line. It
					will understand as a command and its respective parameters (if it
					has any). If the line ends with a ? (question mark), then it will
					understand as a question for a single answer.</p>
					<p>Any other words typed
					in a line, separated with blank spaces, will be considered as a
					fact (atoms connected among them). If you want to consider a longer
					atom (with more than one word), then put those words between ' and
					' (single quotes). So, to enter a fact, you can simply type the
					words you want, followed by ENTER key:</p>
					<p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: dog eats meat
				</div>
				<p>Then to ask something to program, type the atoms you want with "?" at end and press ENTER, like:</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: eats meat?<br/>
					dog eats meat<br/>
					gilgamesh:<br/>
				</div>
				<p>The atoms order in a question does not matter. For commands,
					they are executed by its name followed by ";" and theirs parameters
					if they have:</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: answer; eats meat<br/>
					[ 566053483331700: 6.00000000 = dog eats meat ]<br/>
				</div>
				<p>Were the values represents the timestamp, force and atoms for that fact.</p>
				<p>You can type <b>help</b> to see all supported commands:</p>
				
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: help;<br/>
				</div>				
				<p>You can read a previously created text script with Gilgamesh commands using:</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: script; example.txt<br/>
				</div>				
				<p>And if you want the generated output in another text file, use:</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: script; example.txt; result.txt<br/>
				</div>	
				<p>You can export and import Gilgamesh's memory in a binary file, using:</p>			
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: save; memory.dat<br/>
					gilgamesh: load; memory.dat<br/>
				</div>	
			</div>
			
			<div id="examplesID" class="title3">Practical Examples</div>

			<div class="content">
				<p>Each example below has its own file inside Gilgamesh's
					download file. To execute them, just run the command using the real
					file name:</p>
				<div class="code">
						gilgamesh: script; examples/filename.txt
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="content">
			
				<div id="exampleStockID" class="title4">Stock Flow Control (examples/stock-flow.txt)</div>
				<p>This example is about controlling parts flow in a factory,
					just to demonstrate how Gilgamesh can keep information, without any
					fact reinforcements. Let's suppose you have a small industry and
					wants to register all material that enters and exits your plant.</p>
				<p>Remember that Gilgamesh is an AI system so it will learn
					facts - if you want a system that makes calculations, then probable
					you should customize it through source code or exporting data to a
					worksheet. To register the material flow, you just need to enter
					all information. Example:</p>
				<p>
				
				<table class="datatable">
					<thead><tr><td>Type</td><td>Number</td><td>Part</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr><td>Item</td><td>12358</td><td>Gear</td><td>Part used into gear box, Firebird model</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Item</td><td>35813</td><td>Wheel</td><td>Part used to Corvette, from 1990 to 2010</td></tr> 
						<tr><td>Item</td><td>81321</td><td>Rod</td><td>Replacement part to Porsche, after 2005</td></tr> 
					</tbody>
				</table>
				
				<p>Now what we have to do is to inform what they are:</p>

				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: item 12358 Gear 'Part used into gear box, Firebird model'<br/>
					gilgamesh: item 35813 Wheel 'Part used to Corvette, from 1990 to 2010'<br/>
					gilgamesh: item 81321 Rod 'Replacement part to Porsche, after 2005'<br/>
				</div>

				<p>After this point you have information inside Gilgamesh Core
					memory where you can consult any information about those items.
					This is important because, in fact, it is up to you how to connect
					your fact atoms. So now you can enter some stock during time:</p>

				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: flow 23/01/2014 35813 quantity 5.00<br/>
					gilgamesh: flow 23/01/2014 81321 quantity 2.00<br/>
					gilgamesh: flow 23/01/2014 81321 quantity 22.00<br/>
					gilgamesh: flow 24/01/2014 35813 quantity 10.00<br/>
					gilgamesh: flow 24/01/2014 12358 quantity 35.00<br/>
					gilgamesh: flow 24/01/2014 81321 quantity 7.00<br/>
					gilgamesh: flow 25/01/2014 35813 quantity 16.00<br/>
					gilgamesh: flow 26/01/2014 35813 quantity 19.00<br/>
					gilgamesh: flow 26/01/2014 12358 quantity 44.00<br/>
					gilgamesh: flow 29/01/2014 12358 quantity 11.00<br/>
				</div>

				<p>Every time when you want to query those data, you just need
					to ask Gilgamesh according what you want to know. Let's suppose you
					want to get part numbers registered into memory:</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: answer; item<br/>
					[ 575251487067600: 1.00000000 = item 81321 Rod Replacement part to Porsche, after 2005 ]<br/>
					[ 575251485783800: 1.00000000 = item 35813 Wheel Part used to Corvette, from 1990 to 2010 ]<br/>
					[ 575251424681800: 1.00000000 = item 12358 Gear Part used into gear box, Firebird model ]<br/>
					gilgamesh:<br/>
				</div>
				
				<p>After that, you could ask all entries about a specific item:</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: answer; 12358 flow<br/>
					[ 575251492671700: 2.00000000 = flow 29/01/2014 12358 quantity 11.00 ]<br/>
					[ 575251492174700: 2.00000000 = flow 26/01/2014 12358 quantity 44.00 ]<br/>
					[ 575251490195600: 2.00000000 = flow 24/01/2014 12358 quantity 35.00 ]<br/>
					gilgamesh:<br/>
				</div>
				
				<p>And then query which parts entered in an specific date:</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: answer; 24/01/2014 flow<br/>
					[ 575251490718500: 2.00000000 = flow 24/01/2014 81321 quantity 7.00 ]<br/>
					[ 575251490195600: 2.00000000 = flow 24/01/2014 12358 quantity 35.00 ]<br/>
					[ 575251489643700: 2.00000000 = flow 24/01/2014 35813 quantity 10.00 ]<br/>
					gilgamesh:
				</div>

				<p>If you teach Gilgamesh with specific data types (item, part,
					description etc) it can work similar to a common relational
					database, when the point is to connect fields. However, there is a
					certain flexibility using Gilgamesh because you can dynamically
					define type of atoms, connection among them and how long they will
					be.</p>

				<p>Unfortunately so far, you cannot do any calculations just
					using the shell command: you have to do any kind of source code
					customization. Despite those problems, you still can control data
					like above (actually, this example shows the simplest way to do
					that).</p>


				<div id="exampleMechanicalID" class="title4">Mechanical Diagnosis (examples/mechanical-diagnosis.txt)</div>

				<p>Let's suppose you have a small mechanical workshop where you
					fix cars and you would like to improve the quality of your work,
					anticipating problems that could happen. For all those fixes that
					you did right and knew about the cause, you could enter one record
					into Gilgamesh. Below there is a scenario of 1 week of work:</p>

				<table class="datatable">
					<thead><tr><td>Defect</td><td>Part</td><td>Fix</td><td>Cause</td></tr></thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr><td>noise</td><td>wheel</td><td>bearing</td><td>bad calibration</td></tr>
						<tr><td>fail</td><td>engine</td><td>sparks</td><td>bad calibration</td></tr>
						<tr><td>noise</td><td>engine</td><td>valve</td><td>wasted part</td></tr>
						<tr><td>fail</td><td>suspension</td><td>dumper</td><td>material defect</td></tr>
						<tr><td>noise</td><td>suspension</td><td>dumper</td><td>bad calibration</td></tr>
						<tr><td>noise</td><td>suspension</td><td>spring</td><td>material defect</td></tr>
						<tr><td>fail</td><td>engine</td><td>sparks</td><td>	wasted part</td></tr>
						<tr><td>fail</td><td>wheel</td><td>bearing</td><td>material defect</td></tr>
						<tr><td>fail</td><td>engine</td><td>sparks</td><td>bad calibration</td></tr>
						<tr><td>noise</td><td>engine</td><td>valve</td><td>	wasted part</td></tr>
						<tr><td>fail</td><td>suspension</td><td>dumper</td><td>material defect</td></tr>
						<tr><td>noise</td><td>suspension</td><td>dumper</td><td>bad calibration</td></tr>
						<tr><td>noise</td><td>suspension</td><td>spring</td><td>material defect</td></tr>
						<tr><td>fail</td><td>engine</td><td>sparks</td><td>	wasted part</td></tr>
						<tr><td>noise</td><td>wheel</td><td>bearing</td><td>bad calibration</td></tr>
						<tr><td>fail</td><td>engine</td><td>sparks</td><td>	bad calibration</td></tr>
						<tr><td>noise</td><td>suspension</td><td>dumper</td><td>bad calibration</td></tr>
						<tr><td>noise</td><td>suspension</td><td>spring</td><td>material defect</td></tr>
						<tr><td>fail</td><td>engine</td><td>sparks</td><td>bad calibration</td></tr>
						<tr><td>noise</td><td>suspension</td><td>dumper</td><td>bad calibration</td></tr>
						<tr><td>noise</td><td>engine</td><td>valve</td><td>wasted part</td></tr>
						<tr><td>fail</td><td>engine</td><td>sparks</td><td>bad calibration</td></tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
				
				<p>You could enter those facts above like:</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: noise wheel bearing 'bad calibration'
				</div>

				<p>After entered all information above, we can start asking
					questions. So, what if you want to know what is the most common
					cause to the engine fail?</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: answer; engine fail<br/>
					[ 606282518976900: 10.00000000 = fail engine sparks bad calibration ]<br/>
					[ 606282576606000: 4.00000000 = fail engine sparks wasted part ]<br/>
					gilgamesh:<br/>
				</div>
				
				<p>Now we know that bad calibrations are the most common cause in engine fails. We could check causes for suspension noise:</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: answer; suspension noise<br/>
					[ 606282575635000: 8.00000000 = noise suspension dumper bad calibration ]<br/>
					[ 606282576073900: 6.00000000 = noise suspension spring material defect ]<br/>
					gilgamesh:<br/>
				</div>
				
				<p>The most common is bad calibration too. What if we look defects related to bad calibrations?</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: answer; 'bad calibration'<br/>
					[ 606282518976900: 5.00000000 = fail engine sparks bad calibration ]<br/>
					[ 606282575635000: 4.00000000 = noise suspension dumper bad calibration ]<br/>
					[ 606282445518900: 2.00000000 = noise wheel bearing bad calibration ]<br/>
					gilgamesh:<br/>
				</div>

				<p>So we found out that bad calibrations are causing noise in
					wheels too. In this case, some actions could be taken to verify all
					calibrations in all cars you fix before delivery the car to the
					customer. That could improve the quality of your work.</p>

				<div id="exampleMedicalID" class="title4">Medical Prediction (examples/medical-prediction.txt)</div>

				<p>This is probably the example I like most. That is because
					this is the kind of system which could really help people
					(actually, it is one of the reasons I have decided to made
					Gilgamesh as open source). In my opinion, one prediction system
					like this could reduce medical errors and make the diagnosis
					process faster and more accurate, helping medics to take decisions.
					It could be used to find solutions for diseases which we do not
					know any treatment yet. So, let's consider these things:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Disease: the disease diagnosed by a medic</li>
						<li>Symptom: is what the patient feels.</li>
						<li>Cause: the real problem to be treated.</li>
						<li>Treatment: what was done or drug used to cure people.</li>
					</ul>
				<p>We will connect them as below (there are other ways to connect them, though):</p>
					<ul>
						<li>one disease can have one or more symptoms;</li>
						<li>one disease can have one or more causes;</li>
						<li>one disease has different treatments and we want to know which one is better;</li>
					</ul>

				<p>For this example, we can have more than a single atom of same
					type into a fact (btw, I kept atoms as simple as possible). For
					diseases with their symptoms and causes, single and few facts were
					used. For treatments, shorter and more facts were created and there
					is one row for each treated patient. That allows to Gilgamesh
					chooses the best treatment for each disease. As more information
					you enter, better answers you will get. After load the script:</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: script;examples/medical-prediction.txt<br/>
					Processing done.<br/>
					gilgamesh:<br/>
				</div>

				<p>Gilgamesh has some medical data and it would be ready to be
					used by a medic. During a patient consult, a medic can verify these
					symptoms : "pain", "fever" and "cough". Then, he could starting ask
					to Gilgamesh find what was the most probable disease. Looking for
					"pain", it would bring us all diseases which have pain as symptom:</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: answer; symptoms pain<br/>
					[ 607100915635800: 2.00000000 = hepatitis symptoms appetite fatigue fever nausea vomiting pain jaundice itching bleeding ]<br/>
					[ 607100915322000: 2.00000000 = diabetes symptoms thirsty blurry tingling numbness pain ]<br/>
					[ 607100915003800: 2.00000000 = cancer symptoms pain headache fatigue nausea vomiting ]<br/>
					[ 607100914426800: 2.00000000 = flu symptoms headache fever pain chills fatigue nausea vomiting cough ]<br/>
					gilgamesh:<br/>
				</div>
				
				<p>Including "fever" the list would be shorter, since only flu and hepatitis have both symptoms together:</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: answer; symptoms pain fever<br/>
					[ 607100915635800: 3.00000000 = hepatitis symptoms appetite fatigue fever nausea vomiting pain jaundice itching bleeding ]<br/>
					[ 607100914426800: 3.00000000 = flu symptoms headache fever pain chills fatigue nausea vomiting cough ]<br/>
					gilgamesh:<br/>
				</div>
				
				<p>And finally, including "cough":</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: answer; symptoms pain fever cough<br/>
					[ 607100914426800: 4.00000000 = flu symptoms headache fever pain chills fatigue nausea vomiting cough ]<br/>
					gilgamesh:<br/>
				</div>

				<p>He got only flu as possible answer. Now, based on all medical
					treatment records, the medic could find out what is the best
					treatment for flu:</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: answer; flu treatment<br/>
					[ 607100923881400: 20.00000000 = flu treatment antiviral ]<br/>
					[ 607100922221000: 16.00000000 = flu treatment aspirin ]<br/>
					[ 607100925606800: 14.00000000 = flu treatment codeine ]<br/>
					gilgamesh:<br/>
				</div>
				<p>According treatments that have happened last period, an
					antiviral treatment is being more effective than others. So, it is
					possible to conclude that the system is providing some help to
					medic diagnostics.</p>
				<p>Of course that the example above is very rude
					but the intention is to show how Gilgamesh could be used as a
					learning system, crossing medical data to find best answers to
					diseases treatments, among other things. I hope that someone likes
					this example (and use it in practical ways).</p>


				<div id="exampleMarketingID" class="title4">Marketing Research (examples/marketing-research.txt)</div>

				<p>Marketing professional are used to do market researchs in
					order to identify what customers want. Usually, there are two main
					kinds of researchs: quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative
					researchs gives you result in numbers, so it is easy to measure
					that. In the other hand, qualitative researchs are difficult to
					measure, since they are related about quality descriptions.
					Gilgamesh can be used to help in both researchs, but specially for
					qualitative ones.</p>
				<p>Let's suppose you have interviewed a bunch of people in a
					qualitative research about a shampoo new brand. Now you have all
					answers, you would you like to know some customers intentions
					related to your product. In this example, we are going to simplify
					adjectives in order to simplify the example. First, we have to load
					the example:</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: script; examples\marketing-research.txt
				</div>

				<p>Now we have all opinions about those customers. First of all,
					let's find out what words respondents have used:</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: atoms;<br/>
					fragrant, strong, color, bad, smell, good, transparent, thick, weak, creaminess, citric,
					beutiful, price, dark, wood, floral, smelly, opaque, clear, ugly,
					cheap, thin, expensive, weird, sickly, tasty,<br/>
					gilgamesh:<br/>
				</div>

				<p>So now, let's find out what customers think about our
					shampoo. if you want to know what was the opinion which used more
					"weird" in answers:</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: answer; weird<br/>
					[ 608166392023100: 3.00000000 = smell weird wood floral ]<br/>
					[ 608166412756700: 2.00000000 = smell weird wood smelly ]<br/>
					[ 608166410380600: 2.00000000 = smell tasty strong sickly weird wood floral citric ]<br/>
					[ 608166407951600: 2.00000000 = smell sickly weird wood fragrant ]<br/>
					[ 608166400547900: 2.00000000 = smell good tasty strong sickly weird wood citric ]<br/>
					[ 608166397795300: 2.00000000 = smell good tasty strong sickly weird wood floral citric ]<br/>
					[ 608166396526700: 2.00000000 = smell sickly weird wood weak smelly floral ]<br/>
				</div>

				<p>That means that more people think that smells of wood and
					floral are weird. So, let's
					see what people have realized about the citric smell in our
					product:</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: answer; citric<br/>
					[ 608166401017600: 3.00000000 = smell good citric ]<br/>
					[ 608166410380600: 2.00000000 = smell tasty strong sickly weird wood floral citric ]<br/>
					[ 608166401607300: 2.00000000 = smell good bad fragrant weak smelly floral citric ]<br/>
					[ 608166400771800: 2.00000000 = smell tasty bad fragrant weak smelly floral citric ]<br/>
					[ 608166400547900: 2.00000000 = smell good tasty strong sickly weird wood citric ]<br/>
					[ 608166397795300: 2.00000000 = smell good tasty strong sickly weird wood floral citric ]<br/>
					[ 608166395003800: 2.00000000 = smell wood citric ]<br/>
				</div>

				<p>It seems they liked it. You could ask anything you want, like
					"What do customers think when they have answered 'good price'?",
					"Has someone answered 'smell strong weird'?" or "What opinions
					contains 'strong'?". The possibilities are infinite, all depends
					what you want to know.</p>
				<p>Of course that those random data I have generated to the
					example sometimes do not make any sense (you have atoms like 'good'
					and 'bad' in the same fact). But the point is to show how you could
					use Gilgamesh memory to improve your ability to identify market
					trends, customer wishes etc.</p>
				<div class="code">
				</div>


				<div id="exampleTeamID" class="title4">Team Management (examples/team-management.txt)</div>

				<p>Most examples so far are related to connect a few information
					types. But you can take some advantages from Gilgamesh if you
					connect information of same type or if you don't know (or don't
					want) to classify those information. This example will show you how
					to connect data of same type (players, in this case). Let's suppose
					the following example: you are a paintball team manager and have
					the possibility to assembly your team between 2 and 4 players. To
					the championship, you would like to know which team configuration
					is better in order to have the best performance. Usually what team
					managers do is to choose all those best players and put them
					together. Very often, combining all best players doesn't mean that
					the team will be the best one. Now, what you have to do is: find
					the best players into the best team configuration. Your players
					are:</p>

				<p>
					<b>James, David, Christopher, George, Ronald, John, Richard,
						Daniel, Kenneth, Anthony, Robert, Charles, Paul, Steven, Kevin,
						Michael, Joseph, Mark, Edward, Jason, William, Thomas, Donald,
						Brian, Jeff, Mary, Jennifer, Lisa, Sandra, Michelle, Patricia,
						Maria, Nancy, Donna, Laura, Linda, Susan, Karen, Carol, Sarah,
						Barbara, Margaret, Betty, Ruth, Kimberly, Elizabeth, Dorothy,
						Helen, Sharon, Deborah </b>
				</p>

				<p>So you will enter to Gilgamesh last year game results. You can do that loading the file:</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: script; examples\team-management.txt<br/>
					Processing done.<br/>
					gilgamesh:<br/>
				</div>

				<p>After that, you could ask something: "What the performance is in a team with Karen and Richard?": Let's see:</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: answer; Karen Richard<br/>
					[ 608775534368400: 4.00000000 = Karen Richard ]<br/>
					[ 608775700224100: 2.00000000 = Anthony Deborah Karen Richard ]<br/>
					[ 608775696084600: 2.00000000 = Karen Richard Ronald Susan ]<br/>
				</div>

				<p>Now, what about only Richard and Daniel?</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: answer; Richard Daniel<br/>
					[ 608775636247700: 6.00000000 = Daniel James Richard ]<br/>
					[ 608775576733200: 6.00000000 = Daniel Jennifer Richard ]<br/>
					[ 608775542076900: 6.00000000 = Anthony Daniel Richard ]<br/>
					[ 608775567105600: 4.00000000 = Daniel David Richard ]<br/>
				</div>

				<p>So, we can see that we have a better configuration if we put
					Daniel, James and Richard together in the same team. Again, there
					are a lot of ways you can make questions to the code. It will
					depends what you want to know.</p>


				<div id="exampleProgrammingID" class="title4">Customized Programming Language (examples/custom-prog-lang.txt)</div>

				<p>Sometimes, a common user needs to do some kind of work which
					requests programming knowledge. That implies in a learning curve
					that often is not requested to that professional main role. To have
					that task done, the professional has to request some kind of work
					from a programmer.</p>
					
				<p>Gilgamesh can help with this task, learning a
					new language and helping to simplify that issue. Actually, it can
					learn a pseudo code, that could be used by any common user, since
					he knows what he is doing inside Gilgamesh. The result is much more
					intuitive than most programming languages (it would be similar what
					Ruby on Rails does), allowing a user without any programming
					experience, can do some kind of programming. Let's see what we can
					do.</p>

				
				<p>Supposing that we would like to allow a common user to create
					simple html pages, to include them into a human resource website,
					we could teach Gilgamesh to learn common tasks that the user could
					do, matching (or "translating") them to html code. We could teach
					something:</p>
				<p><b>'start the page' &lt;html&gt;</b></p>
				<p>From now on, every time when we type into the console:</p>
				<p><b>'start the page'?-</b></p>
				<p>The answer would be:</p>
				<p><b>&lt;html&gt;</b></p>
				<p>So you can program using Gilgamesh just asking it to answer
					for what you want to do. E.g.: 'start the page', 'close the page',
					'set the name style' etc. Executing the script
					examples\custom-prog-lang.txt as below, will creates a html file
					called resume.html. Inside that file, you will see the programming
					result of a typed pseudo code.</p>
				<div class="code">
					gilgamesh: script; examples\custom-prog-lang.txt; resume.html<br/>
					Processing done.<br/>
					gilgamesh:<br/>
				</div>

				<p>You can open it in a web browser, like Chrome or Firefox:</p>
				<img src="images/resume.jpg"></img>
